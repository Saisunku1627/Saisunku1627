# Hi, I'm Sai Teja 👋

I'm a data science graduate student based in Denver, focused on **machine learning, LLM/RAG applications, cloud, and data analytics**.  
I enjoy building end‑to‑end projects that combine solid data pipelines, ML models, and practical AI interfaces.

## Tech stack

- Languages: Python, SQL
- ML/AI: scikit‑learn, SentenceTransformers, FAISS, classic ML, LLM/RAG apps
- Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, basic SageMaker, IAM, cost optimization concepts)
- Data: ETL pipelines, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, dashboards (Tableau/Power BI/Looker Studio)
- Tooling: Git/GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, VS Code, Docker (basics)

## Featured projects

- [RAG Document QA](https://github.com/Saisunku1627/rag-document-qa)  
  End‑to‑end Retrieval‑Augmented Generation system over local `.txt` documents using SentenceTransformers embeddings, FAISS vector search, and an LLM backend.

- *(To be added as they’re completed)*  
  - Tabular ML project (e.g., AWS cost or churn prediction with deployment).  
  - Data engineering / analytics project (SQL + dashboards).  
  - RAG Web App (Streamlit/FastAPI UI on top of the RAG backend).

## What I'm looking for

- Data Scientist / ML Engineer / Data Analyst roles
- Opportunities to work on LLM applications, RAG systems, and cloud‑based data prod
